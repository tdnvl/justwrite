# Just write
I am a big fan of [ilys](https://www.ilys.com/) and the idea of moving forward only when writing, without a chance to see the full thing until one wishes to do so. And no backspace. It is a fantastic way to not edit in real-timeâ€”a sure way to never finish a piece or writing.

I decided to challenge myself and create a similar (albeit muuuuch simpler) app to do the same thing without a lot of the great features that ilys offers (hint: give them your ðŸ’°)

This looks very Bootstrappy and I'm open to any suggestions or PRs.
