# Just write
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/a2c15364-c7ba-414b-b43e-07a6bd5fda5c/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/justwrite/deploys)

I am a big fan of [ilys](https://www.ilys.com/) and the idea of moving forward only when writing, without a chance to see the full thing until one wishes to do so. And no backspace. It is a fantastic way to not edit in real-timeâ€”a sure way to never finish a piece or writing.

I decided to challenge myself and create a similar (albeit muuuuch simpler) app to do the same thing without a lot of the great features that ilys offers (hint: give them your ðŸ’°)
